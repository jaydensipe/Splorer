# ðŸš€ Splorer ðŸš€

Splorer is a game created for a Computer Graphics course during my time at college. It helped me understand how games are built on a lower level. Some of the topics covered during creating this project were fragment and vertex shader writing, WebGL development (TWGL.js as a small helper library) and learning to develop in a way that didn't require a game engine.
